# Synopsis

This is a simple TODO app using the MEAN stack

# Motivation

I built this application to become more familiar with the MEAN stack and to learn how to incorporate accessibility with [ngAria](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/accessibility)

# TODO

- Incorporate notification for when a TODO is successfully deleted
- Add **Check All** button or link
- Add **Delete All Completed** button or link
