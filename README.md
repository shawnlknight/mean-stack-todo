## Synopsis

This is a simple TODO app built using the MEAN stack

## Motivation

I built this application to become more familiar with the MEAN stack and Angular in particular. I also wanted to build an accessible app using [ngAria](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/accessibility).

## TODO

* Incorporate notification for when a TODO is successfully deleted
