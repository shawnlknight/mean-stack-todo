## Synopsis

This is a simple TODO app built using the MEAN stack

## Motivation

I built this application to become more familiar with the MEAN stack to learn how to incorporate accessibility with [ngAria](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/accessibility)

## TODO

* Incorporate notification for when a TODO is successfully deleted
* Add **Delete All Completed** button or link
